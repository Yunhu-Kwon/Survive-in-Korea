:: "기사님, 그냥 낙산사로 가주세요.." {"position":"325,675","size":"100,100"}
The driver raced through the hills and finally arrived at Naksansa.
Taxi fare: 80,000 won…

But it’s okay!
At least I made it to the destination!

Now it was time to experience temple life.

A monk greeted me with a warm smile and said:

“Welcome. Please change into your temple robes — it's time to begin your prostration practice.”

[[좋습니다]]

[[내가 왜요.]]


:: "어이 기사, 낙산사로 한 번 가봐!" {"position":"200,675","size":"100,100"}
The driver’s expression started to look… strange.
Did I say something wrong?

Then, he told me to get out.

The Naksansa I saw in the photos was a beautiful temple on a mountain…
But this place wasn’t a temple — it was a cliff.

No other cars were around.
The driver... was already gone.

[[Bad Ending]]


:: "여기까지 와서 잡힐 수는 없지. 평양 냉면 먹어야 돼!" 열심히 뛴다. {"position":"525,675","size":"100,100"}
I heard something behind me...
But I didn’t care.

They used to call me Usain Bolt.
I’m fast.
I’m really fast.

At some point, I couldn’t hear the soldiers anymore.

Then I saw it —
the North Korean flag, just like in all those news reports.

“Finally... I can eat it.
Real Pyongyang naengmyeon. From North Korea itself.”

[[Hidden Ending]]


:: Bad Ending {"position":"200,800","size":"100,100"}
And then... I realized.

Korean has honorifics!

I had learned an important lesson —
but... far too much time had already passed.


:: Bad Ending2 {"position":"1025,900","size":"100,100"}
For the rest of my trip,
I could barely walk.

But I had learned something important...

I realized —
you should treat everyone with respect.


:: Bad Ending3 {"position":"1500,925","size":"100,100"}
I learned…
that trust is truly important.

But still —
the fact remains that I was kicked out of a temple.

At that moment,
I couldn’t help but think…

“I hate Korea.” 😢


:: Bad Ending4 {"position":"1200,1450","size":"100,100"}
I opened my eyes…
and found myself in a hospital bed.

They said I had come down with salmonella.

…

So…
this is why you’re not supposed to touch birds.

I did learn a valuable lesson,
but it feels like…
my journey has come to an end.


:: Best Ending {"position":"1375,1450","size":"100,100"}
You’ve reached the best ending!!

I hope your life in Korea from now on is filled with happiness!


:: Hidden Ending {"position":"525,800","size":"100,100"}
You became a legend —
the one who actually went to Pyongyang just to eat naengmyeon!!

What’s that?
You say this story’s ridiculous?

Well...
As long as it’s fun, who cares? 😎✨


:: Hidden Ending2 {"position":"1675,1250","size":"100,100"}
And so, we ran all through the night.

So close, yet just out of reach...
Our pace matched perfectly —
maybe… this is fate?

Honestly,
I think I found a new connection here in Korea.

And that makes me kind of happy. 😊


:: Lying on the bed {"position":"650,800","size":"100,100"}
Sob... 😢
Korea is scary... 😭


:: after 10 min.. {"position":"1025,775","size":"100,100"}
I suddenly found myself endlessly bowing, over and over again.

Somewhere behind me,
a monk was rhythmically striking the wooden moktak,
his chants almost hypnotic —
and my body moved in sync, like I was under a spell.

Somewhere deep down, I knew…
a leg cramp was coming soon.
And tomorrow,
I probably won’t be able to walk.

[[Bad Ending2]]




:: 가만히 서 있는다. {"position":"650,675","size":"100,100"}
I had no idea what these people were saying,
but I could guess... they were basically telling me I shouldn’t be here.

They put me in a big vehicle
and sent me straight back to the airport in Korea.

The whole day had passed,
and I’d accomplished... absolutely nothing.

I’m too sad to travel anymore.
I just want to lie down on my bed... and stay there.
[[Lying on the bed]]


:: 같이 나눠 먹죠 {"position":"1225,775","size":"100,100"}
My roommate didn’t move an inch.

Then I heard a cat crying outside the window.

“Oh… it was cat food…”

Embarrassed by my own assumptions,
I eventually fell asleep.

The next day, I got ready for my next destination:
the seaside city of Busan, to visit Haeundae Beach!

After a 3-hour train ride, I finally arrived in Busan.

Time to ask someone on the street for directions!

[[해운대 어떻게 가요?]]

[[해운대 한 번 안내 해 봐라.]]


:: 고마워요! {"position":"1550,1125","size":"100,100"}
“Did you just say… thanks?”
“Are you messing with me…?”

The Busan local got even more upset.

Right after I said it, I realized my mistake.
I hadn’t apologized — I had thanked them.

This is not the time to explain.
This is the time to run.

So I bolted. Fast.

...Wait.
They’re chasing me.

And just like that,
the hellish chase began.

[[Hidden Ending2]]




:: 내가 왜요. {"position":"1025,650","size":"100,100"}
The monk smiled gently and chuckled.

“Hoho... So you've come to do 3,000 prostrations, have you?”

I had no idea what 3,000 prostrations meant,
so I just laughed along politely.

“Haha… yeah, I guess so!” 😅
[[after 10 min..]]




:: 너 뭐 아는 거 있니? {"position":"850,500","size":"100,100"}
They looked at me with confused, almost annoyed eyes,
then walked away without a word.

I tried asking a few more people the same question,
but everyone either stared at me like I was strange… or just ignored me.

“Korean people are so cold…” I thought.

In the end, I returned to my lodging, all alone.
Even after arriving,
I couldn’t shake off the memory of those cold, judging stares.

I’m too sad to go anywhere now.
I just want to lie in bed… and do nothing.
[[Lying on the bed]]


:: 미안해요! {"position":"1375,1125","size":"100,100"}
After hearing my apology,
the Busan local softened up and gave me directions!

I followed what they said —
and soon, a wide, beautiful ocean stretched out before me.

Standing there with the sea in front of me,
it felt like all my worries just drifted away.

Seagulls were flying everywhere.
People next to me were feeding them snacks.

“Maybe I should try too.”

I bought some snacks and held one out…
and one of the seagulls actually landed on my hand.

“Should I… try petting it?”

[[쓰다듬는다]]

[[훠이훠이 날려보낸다]]


:: 미쳤어요? 여긴 진짜 북한이잖아요! {"position":"325,525","size":"100,100"}
The driver looked utterly confused and said:

“Wait… didn’t you say you wanted to go to North Korea?
You said you wanted real Pyongyang naengmyeon, so I risked landmines to get us here!”

That’s when I realized…
I had completely messed up what I meant to say.

“Please! Turn around! Right now! Hurry!!”

In the end, I spent 50,000 won on a taxi ride, didn’t even get to eat,
and now I was heading straight to my temple stay reservation — hungry, confused, and spiritually in need of guidance.



[["기사님, 그냥 낙산사로 가주세요.."]]

[["어이 기사, 낙산사로 한 번 가봐!"]]



:: 스님! 여기 반역자가 있어요!!! {"position":"1500,800","size":"100,100"}
After hearing my words, four monks came rushing in.

The noise startled my roommate awake,
and he stared at me in shock.

Then, as I joined the monks to check my roommate’s hand…

What?!

There was… nothing in his hand.

I explained everything in a panic,
and one of the monks calmly said:

“Ah, that smell was just cat food.”

Then, another monk crossed his arms and said sternly:

“We don’t accept people who are this suspicious in our temple.”

And just like that…
I was kicked out of the temple at dawn.

[[Bad Ending3]]


:: 쓰다듬는다 {"position":"1200,1325","size":"100,100"}
It was so cute that I happily gave it a gentle pet!

Then, as I was about to eat…

“Huh...? I feel a bit dizzy…”

“This… this isn’t good…”

My vision began to blur—
and then everything went dark as I collapsed...

[[Bad Ending4]]


:: 좋습니다 {"position":"1225,650","size":"100,100"}
After changing into my temple robes, I cheerfully joined the bowing session.
I didn’t attach much religious meaning to it —
I simply prayed for my family’s health and happiness.

After enjoying the simple but satisfying temple meal,
it was finally time to sleep.

My roommate seemed to have already dozed off,
and just as I was drifting into sleep...

I caught a strange smell.

“Wait… is that… tuna?”

Judging by the smell —
since the temple meals were all plant-based —
it seemed like my roommate had secretly brought a can of tuna from somewhere…
and was trying to eat it.

[[같이 나눠 먹죠]]

[[스님! 여기 반역자가 있어요!!!]]


:: 좋습니다. 언제 또 제가 북한에 가보겠어요, 잘 다녀오겠습니다! {"position":"525,525","size":"100,100"}
In the distance, I saw a group of soldiers.
It was hard to tell which country they were from.

Then suddenly — they spotted me.

The moment they started running toward me,
I froze.

Startled and panicking, I…
[[가만히 서 있는다.]]

[["여기까지 와서 잡힐 수는 없지. 평양 냉면 먹어야 돼!" 열심히 뛴다.]]


:: 평양 냉면 먹으러 가고싶어요! {"position":"800,350","size":"100,100"}
About 30 minutes into the ride, the taxi suddenly stopped.
The driver turned around with a proud smile and said:

“This is the best Pyongyang naengmyeon place I know!
Eat well and enjoy!”

I thanked him sincerely and went in to enjoy the cold noodles — and they were delicious.

Now, it was finally time for some real sightseeing!
I decided to ask a local for recommendations.

It was the perfect moment to show off the Korean I had practiced so hard!

[[혹시 죄송한데, 주변에 갈 만한 관광지 있을까요?]]

[[너 뭐 아는 거 있니?]]

 


:: 평양으로 냉면 먹으러 가고싶어요! {"position":"425,375","size":"100,100"}
The driver nodded.

Having a vague idea that foreigners can go to North Korea somehow,
the taxi driver was suddenly filled with a sense of mission — to get me there at all costs.

Two hours later...

Instead of the clean, modern Pyongyang naengmyeon restaurant I had imagined in Seoul,
I started to see more trees… and grass… and fewer buildings.

Then, the driver looked at me with a grave expression and said:

“This is as far as I can take you. From here... you’re on your own.”


[[미쳤어요? 여긴 진짜 북한이잖아요!]]

[[좋습니다. 언제 또 제가 북한에 가보겠어요, 잘 다녀오겠습니다!]]


:: 한국 탐방 시작! {"position":"625,275","size":"100,100"}
《The Great Korean Misadventure》
I was a foreign student who came to Korea on an exchange program from my home country.
On the plane, I clung to my Korean textbook and practiced saying “Annyeonghaseyo” exactly 382 times. I was overflowing with confidence the moment I arrived.

On the very first day, I got into a taxi straight from the airport.
The in-flight meal had been disappointing, so I decided to challenge myself with Pyongyang naengmyeon (cold noodles) as my first meal in Korea.


[[평양으로 냉면 먹으러 가고싶어요!]]

[[평양 냉면 먹으러 가고싶어요!]]




:: 해운대 어떻게 가요? {"position":"1175,975","size":"100,100"}
Thanks to their kind directions,
I finally arrived at Haeundae Beach! 🌊 

Standing there with the sea in front of me,
it felt like all my worries just drifted away.

Seagulls were flying everywhere.
People next to me were feeding them snacks.

“Maybe I should try too.”

I bought some snacks and held one out…
and one of the seagulls actually landed on my hand.

“Should I… try petting it?”

[[쓰다듬는다]]

[[훠이훠이 날려보낸다]]


:: 해운대 한 번 안내 해 봐라. {"position":"1350,975","size":"100,100"}
I felt like I’d heard it somewhere before…
That people from Busan can be really intense.

Honestly, even if I hadn’t heard it before,
I could tell — just by looking at the person standing in front of me.

“Ah… okay. Yeah.
If you mess up, Busan people really can be scary…”

I didn’t even know what I did wrong,
but one thing was clear:
I should probably apologize.

[[고마워요!]]

[[미안해요!]]


:: 혹시 죄송한데, 주변에 갈 만한 관광지 있을까요? {"position":"1125,500","size":"100,100"}
“I recommend a temple stay! Naksansa would be a great choice!”

I thanked them and set off for Naksansa.

“Thank you so much!”

I arrived!
Now, it was time to begin my temple life.

A monk welcomed me warmly and said:

“Welcome. Please change into your temple robes — it’s time for prostration practice.”

[[좋습니다]]

[[내가 왜요.]]


:: 훠이훠이 날려보낸다 {"position":"1375,1325","size":"100,100"}
It was cute, but I let it go —
now it was my turn to eat something delicious!

I enjoyed a meal at a restaurant with a beautiful ocean view.

I hope the rest of my trip goes just as smoothly,
without any more surprises.

Korea really is a wonderful country. 🌊
